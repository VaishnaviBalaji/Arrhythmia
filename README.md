**Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat

**MAIN_Arrhytmia_5fold.ipynb:**
This is the main coding file that contains the proper preprocessing with appropriate comments, three deep learning neural network models with their evaluations, and acknowledgments 


**Baseline_KNN.ipynb:**
This is the baseline KNN machine learning model with the same pre-processing steps for statistical tests and comparisons 

**R_peaks_hbm.m:**
This is a Matlab file, tried out to demonstrate and understand the sym4 wavelet transform which detects R peaks and heartbeat calculations 

**100m.mat:**
Sample ECG data file in .mat format.
